Dependency:
-----------
Please install boost, you can use the following version or other version.

boost_1_46_1.tar.gz

next lines are the way to install boost
# tar -zxvf boost_1_46_1.tar.gz
# cd boost_1_46_1
# ./bootstrap.sh
# ./bjam
# cp -r boost/ /usr/local/include/

Building:
---------

TripleBit must be build using GNU make and a reasonable C++ compiler. Ideally a simple

   make

is enough, it will build the tree high-level executables in bin/lrelease/.

Using:
------

TripleBit currently includes two high-level executables. The first (buildTripleBitFromN3)
is used to build a new database from an turtle/ntriples input:

   buildTripleBitFromN3 mydata.n3 database_directory

The input file can be arbitrarily large, the buildTripleBitFromN3 spools to disk if
main memory is exhausted.

After loading the database can be queried with triplebitQuery:

   triplebitQuery database_directory query_directory

The program shows a command prompt and accept SPARQL queries.

Note: TripleBit currently only supports "select" queries.
