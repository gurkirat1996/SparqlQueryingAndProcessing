1. Fold/unfold parallel threaded compilation.
Remarks- dhawal- Compiles now.

2. B+ tree in Berkeley DB with bulk, without bulk, and with threads, without threads.
Remarks- gurkirat- fwd/rev queries give correct results. Threading and bulk loading left.

3. Complete AST to BitMat graph translation.
Remarks- dhawal- We have written the function (ast-to-graph-function.cpp), it inserts jvars and tp into graph. 
There was a negative id question (which I have emailed). Please review the code to see if anything is missing, we will then integrate it into bitmat.

4. Performance parameter tweaking of BDB.
Remarks- gurkirat- tweaking left.
5. Comparison chart.
6. Cold cache vs warm cache (/bin/sync, echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches needs sudo perms).
